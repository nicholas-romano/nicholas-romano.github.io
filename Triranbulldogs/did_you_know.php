  <h2>Taking Care of Your Pet</h2>

  <h4>Surviving the Heat</h4>

  <p>Bulldogs and heat do not mix. ... But even if you don't live in Texas, it is recommended by many veterinarians to keep
    Bulldogs indoors when it is 85 degrees or hotter outside. Bulldogs have a tendency to overheat easily, as do many brachycephalic breeds.</p>

  <p>First, let’s look over the signs of an overheating Bulldog:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Excessive panting</p></li>
    <li><p>Heaving while panting</p></li>
    <li><p>Odd sounds coming from the throat</p></li>
    <li><p>Very floppy, loose, discolored tongue</p></li>
    <li><p>Possible foaming from the mouth</p></li>
    <li><p>Exhaustion from the fight for breath</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Here are 5 tips to keep your Bulldog cool:</h4>

  <ol>
    <li><p>Never leave your dog unattended in days of hot weather or while they are in the car.  If you do so, it is very possible that they will overheat which could result in death.  Also, don’t leave your Bully unattended if you have a pool
      on a hot day as they could be tempted to jump in.  Simply put – keep an eye on your fur-baby when it’s hot.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bulldogs need a cool place to stay and sleep in your home during the summer.  Make sure they are always in an air-conditioned and well ventilated room of your house.  Tile can help them cool down when it is hot outside.</p></li>
    <li><p>If you see that your Bully is overheating, it is time to cool him off. Remove him from the hot area immediately.  Place your bully in some cool water, and pour cool water over his head.  If you cannot place him in a tub-like area,
      hose him down with a low pressure spray.  Ensure water reaches and soaks his paws. Make sure he has plenty of cold water to drink.</p></li>
    <li><p>If your Bully is overheated, place your dog by a fan.  Use your fingers to spread his fur to open up his coat to help air flow through to his body.  Do this after you have put him in the tub/poured cool water on him.  Fur acts as an insulator to cold weather so by spreading his/her fur open you are helping to reduce this insulation!</p></li>
    <li><p>Let your Bully see for him/herself how hot it is outside.  If your pup is anxious to go on a walk or wants to go outside badly, sometimes it is best for him/her to feel for themselves how hot it is!  It’s safe to say your Bully won’t want to be outside for too long when it is scorching outside.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>If your Bulldog is overheating on a regular basis, we fully recommend going to see a veterinarian to see if there are any underlying issues.</p>

  <h2>A Bulldog puppy's wrinkles are usually shallow and easy to keep clean.</h2>

  <p>When you think of the words &ldquo;wrinkle care,&rdquo; the first thing that might come to mind is a special heat cycle on your clothes dryer. If your heart has been stolen by a bulldog, however, you owe it to your furrowed friend to learn
    everything you can about the special grooming that this delightful breed requires to stay happy and healthy. While your bully has a short coat that generally needs minimal care, when it comes to the folds around the face, the bulldog's beauty is more than just skin deep. There are health issues that can arise if the wrinkles in your bulldog's face are not properly and routinely cleansed. </p>
